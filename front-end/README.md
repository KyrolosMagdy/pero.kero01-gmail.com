This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

**Note: these notes provided by Me Kyrolos Magdy**

if I was asked to improve this code here is what I well do: 

1- add styled-components (and more CSS improvements).

2- implement tokens and session management more securely.

3- add lazy-loader (so we can only render what the user will see and use and not the whole app).

4- I would recommend using redux-saga for managing states.

5-delete the duplicated code. (I tried to focus on the logic here)

6- implement express-validator

7- install bcrypt.js (so we can install passwords encrypted)
